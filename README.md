# Keylogger-Python
This is an advanced Keylogger that I made using Python. 

This records the keystrokes in a formatted manner, takes screenshots, records microphone audio, saves the details of the host machine and sends all these in an encrypted manner to a GMail. 

> P.S. I would recommend running this program in a Virtual Environment to avoid the issue of collision between various modules. You can take look at [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-virtual-environment/) article to manage Virtual Environments.

To run this program, some additional libraries are required which can be installed using the following command:
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary libraries in the Virtual Environment.

Now, open the source code and make the necessary changes as commented and run the program!
